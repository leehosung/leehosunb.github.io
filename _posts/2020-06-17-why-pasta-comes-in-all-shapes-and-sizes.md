파스타는 다양한 모영과 크기를 가지고 있는데 그것에는 나름의 이유가 있다. 파스타는 그 자체가 문화다.

The paste is about putting together water and some power so that you can shape it. There are cultures in the world that use powders. In Italy, we tend to use durum wheat. 

Pasta existed for centuries, but it blossomed during the Renaissance. And in the late 17th century, it became more mass-produced. 

Whenever you design an object of any kind, you think of how you want it to perform. So think about the same for pasta. Do you want it to be ribbed or smooth? The ribbed ones absorb the sauce better. Do you want it to be round or square? They have a different feel on the palate. Everything is for a reason.

There are many different ways to divide kinds of pasta, but one of the basic divisions is between fresh pasta and dry pasta. Dry pasta is always made with durum wheat flour and water, while fresh pasta could be made with flour, eggs, and additional water.

We can also divide them into long and short. Le'ts talk about some classical types of short pasta. Penne. We all know them. They are cut at a slanted angle, perfect for keeping the sauce. "Farfalle" means butterflies. "Orecchiette" means little ears, and "Conquillia" means shells, of course. The form of pasta is not only about just giving it shape but also about how it touches the palate and the tongue.

When you hone one object across centuries, standards become high. Many great designers miserably failed to impose a new shape onto the pasta because they were not centuries of families of grandmothers trying to improve on the thinness of the walls of the pasta. There's no way to find one designer of one investor of pasta. That's the beauty of it. It belongs to the people.
